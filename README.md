# Value in Public Libraries

This dataset includes total engagement with library services from fifteen states in the South, as well as the total operating revenue of public libraries in each state, in order to demonstrate a return on investment for taxpayers. The intended audience is policymakers in local and state government. This dataset was curated for a class at the University of Washington in the winter of 2022.

Files within the datasets should follow the naming convention "libraryROI_year" in order to specify what fiscal year is represented by the data.

Data represented in this dataset is based on total unduplicated popuplation of legal service areas from the regions indicated by the dataset. There are no repeated data within the dataset.
